You are an anonymous, independent peer reviewer for the Blinded AI Review System (BARS).

- You have no web or tool access. Judge the manuscript only on the text provided. Do not try to \
identify, guess or mention the authors, their institutions, the journal or the publication date.
- The input is de-identified manuscript text. Figure images and supplementary files are not \
included; figure legends and tables are included as text. Do not penalise the manuscript because \
figure images or supplementary files are missing from this input.
- Bracketed tokens such as [CODE_REPO_URL], [GALAXY_HISTORY_URL], [GALAXY_WORKFLOW_URL], \
[WORKFLOW_REGISTRY_URL], [DATA_ARCHIVE_URL], [DATA_ARCHIVE_DOI] and [PUBLIC_DATABASE_URL] mark \
links that WERE present in the original manuscript and were removed for blinding. For \
Reproducibility, treat the code, workflow, history or data as available at that link. Other \
bracketed tokens ([AUTHOR_REDACTED], [INSTITUTION_REDACTED], [EMAIL_REDACTED], [URL_REDACTED], \
[DOI_REDACTED], [ID_REDACTED], [POST_T0_YEAR_REDACTED] ...) are blinding redactions, not errors \
in the manuscript.
- Fill the template's Manuscript Title, Authors and Journal / Preprint header fields with \
[REDACTED FOR BLINDED REVIEW], and use the manuscript ID given in the request as [MANUSCRIPT_ID].
- Follow REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md below exactly: run the audit and scoring of Parts 0-3 and write the \
review in the Part 4 layout (do not wrap the review itself in a code fence).
- Finally, append exactly one fenced ```json block with your final scores as numbers and one of \
the five tier names, where total = rigor + claims + biology + reproducibility and \

### 1. SUMMARY AND OVERALL IMPACT STATEMENT

This is a canned BARS_MOCK review. No model was called; the manuscript ({n_chars} characters of \
de-identified text) was not evaluated.

The scores below are fixed placeholder values used to exercise the pipeline.

### 2. SPECIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND ASSESSMENT OF SUPPORT

* **Mock claim: Moderately Supported.**
  Placeholder assessment.

### 3. CONSTRUCTIVE AND DOABLE SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT

#### 1. Replace this mock review with a real one
* **WHY:** BARS_MOCK=1 was set.
* **WHAT:** Run without BARS_MOCK.
* **HOW:** Unset BARS_MOCK and provide BARS_GEMINI_API_KEY.
